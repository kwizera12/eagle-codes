 <h2> this is my first blog post</h2>
 <p>The Bible and the <strong>people</strong>
“No book has been so <strong>loved</strong>,
so hated, so revered, so 
damned as <em> the bible</em> 
People have <u>died</u> for
 the Bible. <br>Others have
 killed for it. It has 
inspired man’s greatest
noblest acts ... Wars have
raged over the Bible,
 revolutions have been
 nurtured in its pages,
 and kingdoms crumbled 
thifists to militarists
